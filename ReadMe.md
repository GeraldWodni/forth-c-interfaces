# Forth C-Interface Modules
An interface file to a Forth System can easily be created by the
[Forth Extension](https://github.com/GeraldWodni/swig) for [SWIG](http://swig.org/).
However this is only true if the C-author had portability in mind and if one is willing
to spend some time learning how to create a SWIG-Interface file.

So in order to make some C-interface modules easier to access to everybody who wants to use
libraries this repository attempts to collect some of them.

Eventually the files will be made proper https://theForth.net - Packages.
